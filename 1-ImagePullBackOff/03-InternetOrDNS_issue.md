# Kubernetes Troubleshooting: No Internet or DNS Issue

## Scenario: ImagePullBackOff due to Connectivity Issues

If Kubernetes cannot reach Docker Hub or other image registries due to internet or DNS issues, the Pod will enter an `ImagePullBackOff` state.

---

## Simulate the Issue (Advanced / Optional)

To simulate this, you would **manually block outgoing internet access** on the node where the Pod runs.

> **⚠️ Warning:** Skip this step if you're not comfortable editing `iptables` or network configurations.

## Fixing the Problem

### Step 1: Identify and SSH into the Node

1.  **Identify the Target Node:**
    Use `kubectl` to find the node where the problematic Pod is running or where you suspect connectivity issues:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
2.  **SSH into the Node:**
    Replace `<node-ip>` with the external or internal IP address of the target node:
    ```bash
    ssh <node-ip>
    ```

### Step 2: Test Internet and DNS Access from the Node

Once SSH'd into the node, run these commands to diagnose connectivity:

1.  **Test Internet Connectivity (to Docker Registry):**
    ```bash
    curl [https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/](https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/)
    ```
    * **Diagnosis:** If `curl` fails (e.g., connection timed out, host unreachable), it indicates that outbound internet access from the node is blocked.

2.  **Test DNS Resolution (for Docker Registry):**
    ```bash
    nslookup registry-1.docker.io
    ```
    * **Diagnosis:** If `nslookup` fails (e.g., "server can't find"), it indicates that DNS is misconfigured on the node.

### Step 3: Check DNS Configuration

Inspect the DNS resolver settings on the node:

1.  **View Current DNS Configuration:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
2.  **Update DNS Configuration (if necessary):**
    If there's no valid DNS server listed or the existing ones are incorrect, you can update it.
    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
    Add a reliable public DNS server, such as Google DNS, at the top of the file:
    ```
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    ```
    *Save and close the file.*

### Step 4: Check Firewall / Proxy Rules

Ensure that your node's firewall or your corporate network's proxy/firewall allows outbound access to the necessary Docker registry endpoints.

* **Required Access:**
    * `registry-1.docker.io`
    * `*.docker.io` (for other Docker services)
    * **Port 443 (HTTPS)** for all outbound registry traffic.
* **Action:** If you suspect network-level blocking, you may need to ask your network administrator to verify and adjust firewall or proxy rules.

## Summary of Problem and Solutions

| Problem                      | Root Cause                      | Solution                                            |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `ImagePullBackOff`           | No internet or DNS resolution   | Set correct `nameserver` in `/etc/resolv.conf` and re-test access |
| Registry pull fails silently | Firewall blocks registry access | Allow outbound HTTPS (Port 443) traffic to Docker registry domains (`registry-1.docker.io`, `*.docker.io`) |
