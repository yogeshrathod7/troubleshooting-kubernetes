## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scenario: No Internet or DNS Issue

If Kubernetes cannot reach Docker Hub or other image registries due to internet or DNS issues, the Pod will enter an `ImagePullBackOff` state.

---

## üîß Simulate the Issue (Advanced / Optional)

To simulate this, you would **manually block outgoing internet access** on the node where the Pod runs.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip this step if you're not comfortable editing iptables or network configs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix the Problem

### Step 1: Identify and SSH into the Node

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
ssh <node-ip>
```
Replace <node-ip> with the external/internal IP of the target node.
### Step 2: Test Internet and DNS Access
Run these commands from the node:
```
curl https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/
nslookup registry-1.docker.io
```
-If curl fails ‚Üí Internet is blocked
-If nslookup fails ‚Üí DNS is misconfigured

### Step 3: Check DNS Configuration
Inspect the DNS resolver settings:
```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
If there's no valid DNS server listed, update it:
```
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
```
Add this line (Google DNS):
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```
Save and close the file.

### Step 4: Check Firewall / Proxy Rules
Ensure your node or corporate network allows outbound access to:

- registry-1.docker.io
- *.docker.io
- Port 443 (HTTPS)

Ask your network admin if this traffic is being blocked.

| `ImagePullBackOff`           | No internet or DNS resolution   | Set correct `nameserver` and test access |
| Registry pull fails silently | Firewall blocks registry access | Allow outbound HTTPS to Docker registry  |
